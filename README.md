ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @andrewbrr4
- Data scientist
- BA in Mathetmatics and Psychology (2018)
- Music lover, brooklynite, cat-dad

My primary skillset is data science libararies in python, so pandas, sklearn, keras, matplotlib etc. I'm passionate about the interaction between people and machines. As such, a lot of the projects you will find her cover areas of data science that intersect with psychology and cognitive science - such as natural language processing and recommendation systems! I hope you find some of these projects interesting :)
