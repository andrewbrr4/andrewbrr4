ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @andrewbrr4

My primary skillset is ML and AI libraries in python, so pandas, sklearn, pytorch, langchain etc. I'm passionate about the interaction between people and machines. As such, a lot of the projects you will find her cover areas of data science that intersect with psychology and cognitive science - such as natural language processing and recommendation systems! I hope you find some of these projects interesting :)
